// ------------------------------------------------------- focused text box
//
// Which text box the engine currently has focus in, learned from
// `showKeyboard` and needed by `nativePassText`. See the comment on
// `NativeGLJavaInterface::showKeyboard` for why this has to be plumbed through
// rather than assumed.
//
// Written from the engine's thread inside `showKeyboard`, read from the input
// thread when a key is dispatched, so it is guarded rather than plain.

/// The `NativeTextBoxInfo` the engine built for the box it is focusing, in the
/// order its constructor takes its arguments: `(FFFFFZIIIIIIZZ)`.
///
/// This is a widget spec, and Cordial needs it because on Android the engine
/// does not draw a focused TextBox's contents at all — the platform does.
/// Established from the APK's own declarations: `com.roblox.client.RbxKeyboard`
/// extends `q.l` extends `android.widget.EditText`, and
/// `res/layout/activity_game.xml` declares one over the GL surface with
/// `background=@android:color/transparent` and `visibility=gone`. Android
/// raises a real, invisible text editor on top of the game and lets it paint
/// the characters.
///
/// The fourteen values were previously accepted and dropped, on the reasoning
/// that a desktop has no on-screen keyboard so none of this applies. That
/// mistook "no soft keyboard" for "no editor": there is still nothing drawing
/// the text, which is why a focused box stays blank while typing even though
/// the keystrokes now reach the engine.
///
/// Several slots are still named for their position rather than their meaning,
/// because the APK does not say which is which and only some of them have been
/// pinned down by running the thing.
///
/// The dex gives the class's **fifteen** fields — `x y width height fontSize`
/// (F), `editable textWrapped multiline manualFocusRelease` (Z), and `font
/// textColor textInputType returnKeyType xAlignment yAlignment` (I) — but
/// `field_ids` is sorted by name, so that is the *set* of fields and not the
/// order the constructor takes them. Parameter names are stripped from the
/// debug info and the class carries no annotations, so nothing declared in the
/// APK settles it. All the declarations settle is the grouping: slots 0-4 are
/// the five floats, 5, 12, 13 and 14 the four booleans, 6-11 the six ints.
///
/// **This paragraph said fourteen fields and three booleans until 2026-08-27,
/// and it was wrong.** A dex read taken then -- `classes2.dex`,
/// `class_data_off=0x6e33f5`, `field_idx` 4718-4732, bounded either side by
/// `DeviceStaticParams` and `PlatformParams` so the run is this class and only
/// this class -- lists `editable` as a declared field, which this comment had
/// never mentioned. The type tally is 6 I, 5 F, 4 Z, which matches the
/// constructor descriptor `(FFFFFZIIIIIIZZZ)V` exactly. `editable` is the
/// likeliest name for `z14`, the third trailing boolean discovered later and
/// never reconciled with the count above it -- likeliest, not settled, because
/// alphabetical order cannot rank the four booleans any more than it can the
/// six ints.
///
/// The rest came from `CORDIAL_TRACE_TEXT=1` on the Login screen at 1280x720,
/// where two boxes were focused in turn:
///
///     x=470 y=297 w=340 h=22 fontSize=16 z5=0 i6=0 i7=1 textColor=0xffd5d5dd
///                                        i9=46 i10=7  i11=3 z12=1 z13=0
///     x=470 y=363 w=304 h=22 fontSize=16 z5=0 i6=0 i7=1 textColor=0xffd5d5dd
///                                        i9=46 i10=5  i11=1 z12=1 z13=0
///
/// which establishes:
///
/// Slots 0-2 are x, y and width. 470 is exactly (1280-340)/2, and the two boxes
/// share slot 0 while differing in slot 1, which is a vertical stack. Read the
/// other way round the two boxes would be 66px apart horizontally and 340px
/// wide, overlapping each other and running off the surface.
///
/// Slot 8 is textColor: 0xffd5d5dd is an opaque light grey, and nothing else in
/// this class is a packed ARGB word. This is where the obvious guess at the
/// order — the field list read straight off in alphabetical-ish reading order,
/// which puts textColor at slot 7 — is wrong. It was worth not shipping.
///
/// Slots 3 and 4 are height and fontSize in that order, which is not proven but
/// is the only reading that is not absurd: a 22px line box holding 16pt text is
/// a text field, a 16px box holding 22pt text is not. INFERRED.
///
/// **Slots 6, 7, 9, 10 and 11 are now CONFIRMED, not INFERRED, as of
/// 2026-08-30.** This used to read them off two Login-screen boxes alone --
/// `0, 1, 46`, and a pair that differed between the boxes -- and say every
/// word of the reading that follows was a guess, because `Enum.Font.Legacy`
/// is also `0` and fit slot 6 exactly as well as `xAlignment=Left`. That
/// ambiguity is resolved, from outside this codebase entirely: `~/Projects
/// /mocktail`, consulted per AGENTS.md's instruction to check it before
/// inferring a platform contract, implements the same `<init>` hook
/// (`src/jnivm/jnivm.cc:4016-4024`, Apache-2.0) and its varargs reader lists
/// the six int arguments in the order the *constructor declares them*:
/// `xAlignment, yAlignment, textColor, font, textInputType, returnKeyType`.
/// That is a fact about Roblox's platform API -- the shape a real
/// `NativeTextBoxInfo.<init>` call takes -- not about mocktail's own
/// implementation, so taking the order and crediting it is the right side of
/// the line AGENTS.md draws; the values this struct actually held from two
/// login boxes (`0, 1, 46`, then a pair distinguishing Next/Done) were never
/// mocktail's, and still are not. Applied to this struct's own slots, in the
/// order the six ints already sit at (`i6, i7, text_color, i9, i10, i11`):
/// slot 6 is `xAlignment`, slot 7 `yAlignment` -- both renamed below -- slot 9
/// is `font` exactly as `font_slot`'s default of 9 already assumed, slot 10
/// `textInputType`, slot 11 `returnKeyType`. `text_color` sitting between
/// `yAlignment` and `font` is also why the naive alphabetical-ish reading put
/// it at slot 7 and was wrong, noted above.
///
/// `CORDIAL_TEXTBOX_FONT_SLOT` (see `font_slot` in
/// `crates/cordial-runtime/src/android/editor_font.rs`) still defaults to 9
/// and is kept rather than deleted: it is one env var now confirming a fact
/// instead of covering for an unresolved one, and it stays useful if a future
/// Roblox build renumbers the constructor again.
///
/// **Slot 5 is `multiline`, settled 2026-09-04.** This file could not place it
/// from its own captures and said so: both Login boxes are single-line fields
/// and both report 1 at slot 12, which ruled slot 12 out and left slot 5 or
/// slot 13. The same mocktail constructor closes it from the other end --
/// its fourteen-argument form lists `multiline` immediately after the five
/// floats and `textWrapped` last -- so slot 5 is `multiline`, slot 12 is
/// `manualFocusRelease` and slot 13 is `textWrapped`. That is the reading this
/// file already preferred for 12 and 13 from two boxes that both read 1;
/// mocktail corroborates it by declared order rather than by repeating the
/// same weak evidence.
///
/// mocktail's form predates the `editable` field discovered here on
/// 2026-08-27, so `z14` has no counterpart there and stays unnamed. It is the
/// only slot in this struct that still does.
///
/// **What the names are and are not.** They come from mocktail's own `<init>`
/// hook, which assigns them positionally exactly as this one does -- so this
/// is two independent readings of the same constructor agreeing, not a
/// reflection of the real Java class. It is corroboration and it is worth
/// having; it is not proof, and a build that renumbers the constructor would
/// make both wrong together. The captured *values* remain Cordial's own.
///
/// When a slot is settled, rename it here and in `RawTextBoxInfo` in
/// `crates/cordial-linker-sys/src/lib.rs` together. A wrong name would be
/// worse than no name, because it would be believed.

/// `PlatformParams.isTouchDevice`, and it does read that one — measured, twice
/// per cold start — so answering `Android` here contradicted a value the engine
/// had taken from us. (`isKeyboardDevice` and `isMouseDevice` sit beside it and
/// are never read at all; see `native/init_params.cpp`'s header. Do not reach
/// for those two.)
///
/// **What this is not.** It has not been established that this is what makes the
/// client behave as a mobile one; see docs/analysis/platform-identity.md for
/// what was measured and what was not. It is defensible as the truthful answer
/// on its own, independently of what it fixes.
///
/// It is also not settled whether `getPlatformName` means "the platform this
/// client runs on" or "the platform this *user* is on", the console-gamertag
/// sense that `FFlagAddPlatformNameToProfileHeader` and
/// `DFFlagConsumePlatformNameOverAlternateName` both read as. The two senses
