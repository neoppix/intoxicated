// `MainGameActivity.nativeAppBridgeSetInitParams` — the engine's launch state.
//
// Modern Roblox renders its own app shell rather than using Java UI, so the
// engine draws nothing until it has been told where the service lives, what the
// device is, and what the viewport looks like. That is this object.
//
// Field names and types were read out of the shipping APK's dex, not guessed —
// `InitParams`, `DeviceParams` and `PlatformParams` are plain field-carrying
// classes and libjnivm binds field hooks by name and descriptor.
//
// **This file used to claim that `PlatformParams` is where spec §4.2's "Roblox
// thinks you're mobile" is really answered — that `isKeyboardDevice`,
// `isMouseDevice` and `isTouchDevice` decide which input scheme and which UI
// layout the engine picks. Two thirds of that is false.** Measured with
// `CORDIAL_TRACE_PARAM_READS=1` on a cold start: the engine reads `isTouchDevice`
// twice and `dpiScale` three times, and reads `isKeyboardDevice` and
// `isMouseDevice` **not once**. Setting those two to the desktop answer has
// therefore never told the engine anything. The control in the same run is
// `DeviceParams.deviceName`, whose getter fired and whose value came back out of
// the engine as `[FLog::Graphics] Vulkan Android Device: Cordial`, so the probe
// was working when the two peripheral fields stayed silent.
//
// What that leaves: the engine is told there is no touchscreen, and behaves as a
// mobile client anyway. Whatever carries "there is a keyboard and a mouse here",
// it is not this object. See docs/analysis/platform-identity.md.

/// for a browser `User-Agent` -- the branch roblox.com makes is app against

/// GooglePlayStore)
/// ```
///
/// **Worth being exact about, because a shorter reading of that same file
/// caused a wrong brief:** Sober does send `ROBLOX Android App` and `Tablet
/// Hybrid()`. What it does *not* send is the parenthesised device block --
/// no memory, no resolution, no DPI, no API level -- and its WebKit token is
/// WebKitGTK's own. Only the trailing `RobloxApp/...(GlobalDist; ...)` clause
/// is what "the bare token" means, and that clause alone is enough for
/// roblox.com to serve the app layout, which the table above is the control
/// for.
///
/// So `roblox-app` claims to be the Roblox app and declines to claim a form
/// factor at all: no phone, no tablet, no Windows PC, and no device block full
/// of numbers whose only purpose is to look like hardware Cordial is not. The
/// channel stays `Cordial` rather than borrowing `GooglePlayStore`, on the same
/// rule every other identity field in this file follows.
///
/// **What this does not do, and must not be read as doing.** It is an identity,
/// not a graphics-quality request. Nothing here has established that Roblox
/// tiers its graphics defaults off the `User-Agent` at all -- the engine builds
/// its picture of the machine from `InitParams` (memory, resolution, density,
/// `isTablet`), which is a different set of values reaching it by a different
/// route. [`AndroidTablet`] is the only identity that asserts a mobile form
/// factor, through `InitParams.isTablet`, and it is the one to reach for if
/// mobile-tier defaults are what is wanted.
///
/// Worth knowing before changing this: the engine being loaded is Roblox's
/// **Android** build whatever this says. `osVersion` stays "33" in all three
/// profiles -- see the comment at that field, which records the engine
/// refusing Vulkan when it was lowered -- so the identity is not internally
/// uniform and nobody should read it as a complete disguise.
///
/// The accepted spellings match `crates/cordial-runtime/src/flags.rs`'s

///
/// `nativeInitializeNativeFlags` does not merely consume the flags — it *returns*
/// one of these, which it builds itself over JNI: `new NativeFlagsInitResult(id)`
/// then `addBoolean` per flag. With the class unimplemented the native could not
/// construct its result, so every flag load failed no matter what was passed in.
/// That is what `onFlagsFailed` was reporting.
///
/// **The root cause, found only by watching the live JNI trace, not by reading
/// disassembly:** libjnivm's own `GetMethodID` (`third_party/libjnivm/src/jnivm/
/// internal/method.cpp`) rewrites every *instance* lookup of `"<init>"` into a
/// **static** lookup before it ever consults the registered method table:
///
/// ```cpp
/// // Rewrite init to Static external function
/// if(!isStatic && sname == "<init>") {
///     // strips everything after ')' and appends "L<nativeprefix>;"
///     return GetMethodID<true, ...>(env, cl, str0, rewrittenSignature);
/// }
/// ```
///
/// So when the engine calls `GetMethodID(class, "<init>", "(I)V")`, libjnivm
/// actually looks for a **static** method named `"<init>"` with signature
/// `"(I)Lcom/roblox/client/flags/NativeFlagsInitResult;"` — a factory, not a
/// constructor. Registering `ctor` with `HookInstanceFunction` (an *instance*
/// hook, original `"(I)V"` signature) can never match that lookup. The engine
/// got an unresolved-symbol stub back, called it, got a null/default object, and
/// reported `onFlagsFailed` — nothing to do with the flag *contents* at all.
/// Confirmed live: before this fix, the JNI trace showed
/// `Constructed Unresolved symbol, Class=`NativeFlagsInitResult`,
/// StaticMethod=`<init>`, Signature=`(I)Lcom/.../NativeFlagsInitResult;`
/// immediately followed by `Call Unknown Static Function ... <init> ...` and
/// then `gameActivity_onFlagsFailed`.
///
/// The fix follows the same static-factory idiom already used elsewhere in this
/// file (`DeviceStaticParams::Create`, `JavaMap::Create`, etc.): register `ctor`
/// as a plain static function taking `(ENV*, Class*, jint)`, which `Class::Hook`
/// installs as a *static* method — its derived signature is exactly
/// `"(I)L<nativeprefix>;"`, matching libjnivm's rewritten lookup.

///
/// The cause of the store never appearing was `nativeSetCacheDirectory` being
