// Driving AGDK `GameActivity` bring-up.
//
// On Android the platform calls `GameActivity.initializeNativeCode` from Java
// with a real Activity behind it. Cordial has no Java, so it constructs the
// arguments through libjnivm and calls the exported JNI native directly:
//
//     jlong Java_com_google_androidgamesdk_GameActivity_initializeNativeCode(
//         JNIEnv*, jobject thiz,
//         jstring internalDataPath, jstring obbPath, jstring externalDataPath,
//         jobject assetMgr, jbyteArray savedState, jobject config)
//
// The descriptor came out of the shipping APK with tools/dex_method.py, not from
// AGDK's source — it changes between versions and Roblox ships whichever it
// built against.
//
// The returned handle is what every later callback carries:
// onSurfaceCreatedNative, onSurfaceChangedNative, onKeyDownNative and the rest.

/// the swapchain showed a blank grey window in both arms, byte-identical to
/// each other, presenting about 255 empty frames a second. The comment further
/// down this function had already said why -- the engine builds its renderer on
/// resume -- and the survey scored those blank clients healthy because its
/// verdict counts presents. They are instruments for locating the freeze. Do
/// not ship one.
///
/// **Two working references say this path is not the one the engine expects.**
/// Roblox's own Android build does not take it: `EnableGameActivity8` resolves
/// to false in `docs/traces/waydroid-roblox-startup.log.gz:626`, and across all
/// 2432 lines of that capture no GameActivity native is called even once. And
/// mocktail defaults all three of its equivalent switches off, with its
/// authors' reason written beside them at `src/legacy/legacy_runtime.cc:2867`
/// (Apache-2.0): the glue "currently stalls V2 init on surface flags", and the
/// lifecycle callbacks "can block on `android_app_set_activity_state` in some
/// Linux shims". Read there; the switches here are ours.
///
/// What makes that worth a switch rather than a note is that Cordial delivers
/// the surface through the app bridge as well -- `appbridge_start_app` and
/// both `UpdateSurface...WithPlatformParams` calls, at `load.rs:3849-3899` --
/// so by the time the calls below run, the engine has already been told about
/// this surface twice. These drop each half of the third delivery, separately,
/// because a startup that wedges 80% of the time on a signed-in profile is the
/// symptom mocktail describes and nobody here has ever run the arm without it.
///
/// **Not to be confused with `CORDIAL_SKIP_AGDK`**, which is a far larger
/// switch: it drops `initializeNativeCode` too, and that is what brings the
/// TaskScheduler up. The engine will not load flags behind a live scheduler,
/// so that path dies on `Can't initialize the TaskScheduler before flags have
/// been loaded` about half a second in -- measured three times out of three on
/// 2026-08-27, and explained in `docs/analysis/flag-init.md` 19.1 long before
/// that. These two leave all of it alone and change nothing but the calls.

///
/// It is not a fix, and these two exist because of what else that arm did.
/// Counting every shape of stall rather than the survey's threshold it was
/// 4/15 against 9/15, p = 0.14, and two of those runs were a failure the
/// control never produced once -- stuck on the Startup screen past a hundred
/// seconds while presenting twenty-six thousand frames. The engine also
/// stopped logging `StartupController started: stage` in all fifteen, against
/// four of fifteen controls. Something real changed and not all of it was an
/// improvement.
///
/// The split is where the mechanism is. `onStartNative` and `onResumeNative`
/// reach `android_app_set_activity_state`, which writes its command and then
/// **blocks on a condition variable until the engine's own loop acknowledges
/// it**; `onWindowFocusChangedNative` writes and returns. mocktail names that
/// function specifically (`legacy_runtime.cc:2872`, Apache-2.0). A wait for an
/// acknowledgement that never comes is the shape of every capture taken of
/// this freeze: nine events delivered on the command pipe, a tenth that never
/// arrives, and the write end of that pipe open in the same process.
///
/// So these two arms answer different questions. `CORDIAL_SKIP_AGDK_STATE`
/// drops only the pair that can block. `CORDIAL_SKIP_AGDK_FOCUS` drops only
/// the one that cannot, and is the control for it -- if the freeze moves when
/// focus alone goes, the blocking-ack account is wrong and should be dropped.
///

//

// out of the shipping APK's dex with `tools/dex_method.py` and cross-checked
// against `readelf --dyn-syms` on `libroblox.so`; none of them is guessed. What
// *is* guessed, and is marked INFERRED wherever it appears, is what the integer
// arguments mean -- the dex carries types and not parameter names.
//
// The thing worth knowing before reading any of this: this build has no
// type-less connect entry point. `nativeGamepadConnectEvent` is absent from both
// the dex (`dex_method.py` prints `no match`) and the export table (`readelf |
// grep -c` prints 0), so a pad cannot be announced to this engine without
// supplying a `gamepadType` whose ordinals nothing available here establishes.
// `android::gamepad` is off by default for exactly that reason; that module's
// comment carries the whole argument.
//
// No rumble. `android/os/Vibrator` is declared in the dex and implemented
// nowhere in Cordial, and a force-feedback call that silently does nothing is
// the stub that lies. It is absent rather than stubbed.
//
// The atomic-gating rule these serve -- resolve all of the registration natives
// or use none of them -- is mocktail's (Apache-2.0,
// `src/runtime/roblox_capability_resolver.cc`), which nulls its whole gamepad
// symbol set when the `WithGamepadType` trio is incomplete rather than falling
// back to the removed exports. The idea, not the code.

/// this interface whose name ends `WithGamepadType` is its type-less TV-remote
/// counterpart plus exactly one trailing `int` -- `nativeTVRemoteConnectEvent(I)`
