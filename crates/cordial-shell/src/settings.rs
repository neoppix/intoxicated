//! The minimal settings fallback ADR-002 requires.
//!
//! Not the settings surface — the UI plugin owns that once it takes over at
//! T3. This exists purely for the recoverability argument ADR-002 makes: if
//! the UI plugin is broken (bad update, protocol mismatch after a Cordial
//! upgrade), the user still needs a way to see what is installed and turn
//! the offending one off, plus enough of Cordial's own appearance and
//! graphics preference to be usable, without a terminal.
//!
//! `AdwPreferencesDialog` with several `AdwPreferencesPage`s — Roblox, Updates,
//! General, Plugins, Report — each becomes its own tab/sidebar entry for free;
//! that is libadwaita's own page-switcher, not something built here. Appearance
//! used to be its own page; its two groups live inside General now, and
//! `build_preferences_window`'s own comment explains why.
//!
//! The Roblox page is newer than the argument above and is here for a different
//! reason: nothing in Cordial used to record where a Roblox build lived, so the
//! chooser had no target and the only way to run the client was a hand-typed
//! command line. That is configuration rather than a fallback, and it belongs
//! in the shell because the shell is what has to work when nothing else does.

/// whose entire job is telling somebody what has been granted what, on a machine
/// where `~/.local/share/cordial/plugins` is empty. ADR-003's default-deny means
/// nothing if the surface that displays it is fiction, and "this plugin may
/// change your assets and talk to Discord for you" is not a sentence to invent.
///
/// Three states, kept apart because somebody debugging a plugin that is doing
/// nothing has to be able to tell which one they are in.

/// declines to name a host or ship a signing key — see

/// nothing here to point at until the user supplies a directory of their own:
/// a local checkout of an index repository (`index.json`, an optional
/// `index.json.minisig`, and an `archives/` directory), exactly what
/// ADR-014 already designs an index to be. Pointing this at a directory with
/// no key configured still lists what it offers, because a user cannot decide
/// whether to trust something they cannot see; every Install button stays
/// refused, with the reason stated on it, until a key is set and verifies.
///
/// Two groups rather than one, because they change on different occasions:
/// configuration (the directory, the key) changes rarely, and the listing is
/// rebuilt every time "Check for plugins" is pressed. Rebuilding the whole
/// page on every refresh would also discard whatever the user had just typed

/// about which document enablement is stored in and which ADR decided that.

/// off.** Hiding the lists would leave somebody unable to see what they have
/// installed, or to find the one plugin they wanted to check on, without first
/// turning plugins back on — and the state they are trying to reason about is
/// exactly the one where plugins are off.
/// Returns the page and the Installed group, because "Get Plugins" has to add
/// a row to that exact group the moment an install succeeds. Handing the group
/// back is what keeps one `build_plugin_row` serving both — the alternative
/// this project has already been bitten by is a second, similar-looking row
/// built in the installer's callback that drifts from this one.
