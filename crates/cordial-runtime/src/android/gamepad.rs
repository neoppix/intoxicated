//! Gamepads, from the host's joystick devices into `NativeInputInterface`.
//!
//! **This is off by default, and the reason is a blocker rather than caution.**
//!
//! The six gamepad natives are real: `tools/dex_method.py` reads all six
//! descriptors out of the shipping APK's dex, and `readelf --dyn-syms` finds all
//! six exported by `libroblox.so`. What is missing is one integer's meaning.
//! This build ships no type-less connect entry point -- `nativeGamepadConnectEvent`
//! returns `no match` from the dex and `0` from `readelf | grep -c` -- so a pad
//! cannot be announced without supplying a `gamepadType`, and nothing available
//! here says what the ordinals are:
//!
//! `docs/traces/waydroid-roblox-startup.log.gz` has no gamepad line in it at
//! all, because the capture was taken with no pad plugged in. The dex declares
//! no class with `Gamepad` in its name, and the Java caller is obfuscated.
//! mocktail resolves all six symbols and never calls one of them. The only
//! signal in the binary is three glyph asset folders -- `DefaultController`,
//! `PlayStationController`, `XboxController` -- beside a reflected
//! `RBX::GamepadType`, which suggests how *many* values there are and says
//! nothing about which is which.
//!
//! Reading that as "0 = unknown, 1 = PlayStation, 2 = Xbox" would be exactly the
//! wrong-but-plausible conclusion AGENTS.md's opening rule is about, and the
//! wrong outcome is already a live bug next door: Sober #1018 is
//! *"Sober detects my PS4 controller as a XBOX one"*. So Cordial does not guess
//! it on a user's behalf. Nothing here calls the connect native until somebody
//! sets `CORDIAL_GAMEPAD=1`, and when they do they are told the type is unverified.
//!
//! **The experiment that settles it, and what this module exists to make
//! possible.** Because the glyph folders are per-type, the engine's own UI is a
//! readout of `gamepadType`: announce a pad with type N, open something that
//! draws button glyphs, and photograph the frame with `cordial_screenshot` out
//! of Cordial's swapchain. The N that draws PlayStation glyphs *is* PlayStation,
//! and a different N drawing different glyphs is the control. `CORDIAL_GAMEPAD_TYPE=N`
//! is that sweep, and `CORDIAL_GAMEPAD_PROBE=1` runs it with no hardware at all
//! -- it announces one synthetic pad and sends nothing.
//!
//! **"Which is enough to draw the glyphs" used to follow that sentence, and it
//! is wrong.** Reported by the project owner from ordinary use on 2026-08-30:
//! Roblox switches its displayed glyph set only when an input is actually
//! *used*, not when a device is announced. A pad that connects and then sends
//! nothing changes nothing on screen, so the probe as built cannot produce the
//! reading this module was designed around. Labelled as a user report rather
//! than a measurement here, because it was not taken with an instrument -- but
//! it explains a run that would otherwise look like a mystery, and it should be
//! believed before it is re-tested.
//!
//! It was re-tested first, and agrees. A sweep of N = 0, 1, 2 and 99 on
//! 2026-08-30 found the pre-login Landing and Sign In screens identical for
//! every N, with no button glyph anywhere in the frame -- and 99, far outside
//! any plausible enum, no more distinguishable than 0. Two independent reasons
//! for that null result now stand: no input was sent, and the shell is not
//! where glyphs are drawn in the first place. Sober #584 and #1810 both place
//! the wrong-type symptom inside an experience rather than in the shell.
//!
//! **So the experiment needs two changes before it can work**, and neither is
//! large: the probe must *send* an input after announcing -- a button press and
//! release, or an axis deflection, is enough to make the engine switch -- and
//! the observation must be made inside a joined experience rather than at the
//! shell. Second best is re-capturing the logcat with a pad attached.
//!
//! **Run 2026-08-30, and `Landing`/`Login` are ruled out as the screen.** N
//! swept over 0, 1, 2 and 99 all reach the pre-login `Landing` page identically
//! -- same generic focus outline, no button-shape icon anywhere in the frame,
//! `N=99` no more distinguishable or crash-prone than `N=0`. `Sign In`'s
//! username/password form has no controller affordance either. That is the
//! module's own control working as designed: four different N, zero different
//! glyph sets, is a finding about the *screen* having no readout, not a claim
//! that the ordinals are equal. Sober's issues #584 and #1810 both describe the
//! wrong type surfacing *inside a game*, not in Sober's shell, which points the
//! actual readout in-experience rather than pre-login on that runtime too. A
//! repeat of this sweep needs a signed-in profile that reaches `Home` and joins
//! a place -- see `docs/NEXT.md`'s entry of the same date before spending a
//! session re-confirming Landing draws nothing.
//!
//! **No rumble.** `android/os/Vibrator` is declared in the dex and implemented
//! nowhere in Cordial. Force feedback is out of scope here and is absent rather
//! than stubbed, because a rumble call that silently does nothing is the stub
//! that lies.
//!
//! **The host half is a placeholder and is meant to be replaced.** It reads
//! Linux's legacy joydev nodes (`/dev/input/js*`) with plain `std::fs` and no
//! new dependency, because the alternative -- gilrs, which is the right answer
//! -- carries `libudev-sys`, whose `build.rs` is an unconditional
//! `pkg_config::find_library("libudev").unwrap()` and whose binaries link
//! `libudev.so.1`. Cordial has no udev anywhere in `Cargo.lock` today, and
//! taking that on touches the flatpak, deb, rpm and AppImage manifests and CI.
//! That is a packaging decision, not an implementation detail, and it should not
//! ride in on a feature that cannot be switched on yet.
//!
//! What is lost by waiting is real and worth naming: joydev reports *indices*
//! rather than button codes, so [`button_keycode`] and [`axis_code`] are a fixed
//! table for the standard layout rather than a per-device mapping. gilrs carries
//! `SDL_GameControllerDB`, which is that mapping for thousands of pads, and it
//! also exposes the vendor and product ids a `gamepadType` classifier would want
//! once the ordinals are known. When the udev dependency is accepted, this
//! module's [`poll`] is the seam to swap underneath.
//!
//! TASKS.md recommends `libmanette` for this and should not: it has no Rust
//! binding at all (`cargo search libmanette` returns nothing), so adopting it
//! means hand-written GObject FFI. TASKS.md also points this work at the
//! GameActivity motion-event path, which is the pipe
//! `native/game_activity.cpp` records as accepted-and-ignored -- every click
//! delivered that way was taken and nothing on screen moved. Gamepad goes
//! through `NativeInputInterface` for the same reason the mouse does.
