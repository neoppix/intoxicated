//! Draw the text editor in the font the engine asked for.
//!
//! The editor is a `gtk::Text` placed on top of a box the engine drew, so the
//! moment it appears the string is re-rendered by a different text stack. Get
//! the family wrong and the characters change shape and weight under the
//! user's cursor -- reported as "the text shifts a lot when you select the
//! text box, like gtk doesnt match the text size as good". Matching the
//! family was never going to be enough either: the *size* the engine hands
//! over is denominated in its own font's metrics, and drawing it verbatim in
//! a different font is why text visibly jumps when a box gains or loses
//! focus -- see [`parse_mappings`]'s note on `fromRbxFontRatio`, which used to
//! say applying it was a mistake and was measured to be the mistake instead.
//!
//! That matters more here than it would elsewhere, because the editor is what
//! the player actually sees. The engine stops drawing the box's own text while
//! it is focused and resumes on blur, so during editing these glyphs are the
//! visible text rather than an overlay on top of it.
//!
//! **Nothing here vendors a Roblox asset and nothing may.** AGENTS.md rules
//! out committing an APK or anything out of one -- and that covers the id
//! table as much as the font files, which is why there is no id-to-family
//! literal anywhere below. This reads both from the APK the *user* supplied,
//! which is the same posture as every other asset: Cordial ships none and
//! works from the copy on the machine. Extracted files land in the cache
//! beside the extracted libraries, and are rewritten only when their size
//! differs, so a launch does not rewrite them every time.
//!
//! ## Where the font id comes from, and what is still unknown
//!
//! **The engine names the font.** `com.roblox.engine.jni.model.NativeTextBoxInfo`
//! -- the styling spec handed to `showKeyboard` -- declares an `int` field
//! spelled exactly `font`, read out of `classes2.dex` on 2026-08-27.
//! `assets/android/fonts/font-mappings.json` in the same APK maps that integer
//! to a font file. So a per-box font needs no hand-maintained table that would
//! rot across Roblox builds; the authoritative one is already on disk.
//!
//! **Which constructor slot carries the id is now confirmed, as of
//! 2026-08-30.** This used to say slot 6 fit the two-box capture (`0` on
//! both) exactly as well as `Enum.Font.Legacy=0`, because nothing here could
//! tell "the font id, always Legacy" from "some other field, always zero"
//! apart. That ambiguity is resolved from outside this codebase: mocktail
//! (`~/Projects/mocktail/src/jnivm/jnivm.cc:4016-4024`, Apache-2.0) implements
//! the same `NativeTextBoxInfo` constructor and lists its six int arguments in
//! declared order as `xAlignment, yAlignment, textColor, font, textInputType,
//! returnKeyType` -- a fact about Roblox's platform API, taken and credited
//! rather than copied, per AGENTS.md's line between the idea and the
//! transcription. Slot 6 is `xAlignment`, not `font`; `font` is slot 9,
//! exactly where [`font_slot`]'s default already pointed it. `slot_value`
//! keeps reading positionally rather than by field name -- see that
//! function's own doc comment for why -- but the slot it defaults to is now
//! corroborated instead of merely chosen under ambiguity.
//!
//! Reading `TextBox.FontFace` out of the DataModel would answer it directly and
//! is permanently out of scope: that is in-process introspection of the engine,
//! which ADR-001 and ADR-003 rule out. Disassembling the constructor's `iput`
//! order would also answer it, and is declined on the licence line in
//! AGENTS.md -- declared shapes and call order are observation, the body of a
//! method is how it implements something.
//!
//! ## Two corrections to what was written down before this module was widened
//!
//! **The shipped table is not gapless and does not cover every `Enum.Font`.**
//! `docs/NEXT.md` and this file both called it "a 48-entry table ... in a
//! gapless run". 48 entries is right and the run 44-51 is gapless, but the ids
//! are `1, 2, 6..51`: **0, 3, 4 and 5 have no row at all**, and 3-5 are
//! `SourceSans`, `SourceSansBold` and `SourceSansLight`, which is the engine's
//! own default face for an unstyled TextLabel. `SourceSansPro-Regular.ttf`
//! ships in the same archive and the table simply does not point at it.
//! Roblox's own Android mapping not covering Roblox's own default font is the
//! strongest available evidence that a fallback is mandatory rather than a
//! nicety -- their code must have one too. Cordial does not paper over the gap
//! with a hand-written row, because a literal `3 => "SourceSansPro-Regular"`
//! here is exactly the hand-maintained table that must not be written: it is
//! knowledge about Roblox's enum rather than something the archive says, and
//! nothing would tell us when it stopped being true. An id with no row falls
//! back to the default family and says so once.
//!
//! **`assets/content/fonts/families/*.json` is not the source for the family
//! string.** This file used to say it "gives the family string Pango wants",
//! and that is right for `BuilderSans.json` and wrong in general. Pango asks
//! fontconfig, and fontconfig reads the font file, not Roblox's manifest. The
//! two disagree: `LegacyArimo.json` and `LegacyArial.json` both declare
//! `"name": "Arimo (Legacy)"` while both pointing at `Arimo-Regular.ttf`,
//! which fontconfig reads as family `Arimo` -- so inverting the manifests is
//! not even a function, one file carries three different declared names. Their
//! weights disagree too: `ComicNeue-Angular-Bold.ttf` is declared as the
//! `Regular` face at weight 400 and fontconfig reads it as weight 700.
//! `FcFreeTypeQuery` on the extracted file is therefore the source used here,
//! because it is by construction the answer Pango will resolve against.
//!
//! ## Cost, and why the whole set is registered at once but not at launch
//!
//! Measured on this host against the user's own APK, 46 distinct files:
//! `FcConfigAppFontAddFile` accepted 46 of 46 in 48.8 ms and `FcFreeTypeQuery`
//! read family, weight and slant from all 46 in 10.7 ms. So registering
//! everything is cheap in absolute terms, but it also means extracting about
//! 7.2 MB out of the archive -- on every launch, for a feature that only
//! matters once a game restyles a box.
//!
//! The compromise is that [`install`] still does exactly one font at window
//! creation, so a launch costs what it costs today, and the full set is built
//! on the first font lookup instead -- which happens when a TextBox is first
//! focused, long after startup. The whole set goes in together rather than one
//! file per id so that a family is never handed to Pango before its file is in
//! fontconfig, which is the ordering the existing single-font path already
//! relies on.
//!
//! `FcConfigAppFontAddFile` is reached through `dlsym` rather than linked.
//! fontconfig is already in the process -- GTK cannot render without it -- and
//! dlsym keeps it from becoming a build-time dependency of this crate for one
//! call. The same pattern `vulkan.rs` uses for the loader.
