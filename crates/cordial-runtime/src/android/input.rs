//! Display-server-independent input plumbing, shared by [`super::window`] (X11)
//! and [`super::wayland`].
//!
//! X11 delivers keysyms directly. Wayland delivers raw evdev keycodes plus an
//! xkb keymap the client has to interpret itself — see ADR-011. Everything
//! *below* that difference is identical: both backends end up with a keysym, a
//! button number, or committed text, and from there the two paths converge.
//! This module is that convergence point. It used to live inside `window.rs`,
//! written for the only backend that existed; the text-entry state machine in
//! particular (`TextField`, the caret arithmetic, the reseed-on-focus-change
//! logic) took real iteration to get right — see the tests below — and a
//! second display backend is exactly the situation duplicating it would have
//! caused a second, silently-diverging copy of the same bugs to be fixed twice.
//!
//! What stays behind in each backend is the part that is genuinely
//! display-specific: opening a connection, reading its events, and turning
//! them into the keysym/button/text vocabulary this module speaks.

// replaces that Java, so the routing is ours to do, per event.
//
// Which is what makes it reversible. `UserInputService.PreferredInput` and
// `LastInputType` follow the last device used and change back the moment the
// other one is touched, which is the behaviour a phone with a keyboard cover
// has. (`TouchEnabled`/`KeyboardEnabled`/`MouseEnabled` are a different signal
// -- a capability latch that goes true on first use and is never revoked. Sober
// #1577, a hybrid laptop stuck in mobile controls, is a game reading the latch.
// Nothing on this side can un-latch it, and nothing here tries to.)

/// collapse from ~60/s to exactly 1.0/s about thirteen seconds into an idle
/// app shell, and that driving `pass_mouse_move` continuously holds it at
/// 50-60/s indefinitely — but that measurement drove mouse movement, camera
/// look and held keys all together, so it could not say which one the engine
/// was actually watching. Measured in isolation (`CORDIAL_SCRIPT=key-on`,
/// `touch-on`, `look-on`, `ping-on` against a real `libroblox.so`, landing
/// page, no account): a single held key produces exactly one down event under
/// Wayland (`keyboard_repeat_info` in `wayland.rs` is a documented no-op, and
/// nothing here reintroduces repeat), and that one event does not stop the
/// collapse — it lands at the same ~15s mark as no input at all, twice.
/// Redriving `deliver_key`/`pass_key_event` on every tick, simulating what a
/// repeat timer would send, does not stop it either. Redriving
/// `deliver_mouse`'s AGDK touch queue every tick does not stop it. Only
/// `pass_mouse_move` — `NativeInputInterface.nativePassMouseMove`, the "V2"
/// interface call, not AGDK's `onTouchEventNative` — keeps it away, and it
/// does so with the delta held at exactly zero: a fixed position resent every
/// tick holds presents at a flat 60.0/s for the whole run, no less reliably
/// than a moving one, and collapses within about a second of stopping. So the
/// engine is watching this one call landing, not the camera actually turning.
///
/// **Why a real position matters.** The dex declares this native as an
/// absolute position plus a delta, and `MOUSE_LAST` is the last position a
/// genuine pointer event reported — reusing it, with a (0, 0) delta, tells the
/// engine truthfully where the pointer already is and that it has not moved,
/// which is honest in both halves. Inventing a position (window centre, say)
/// would tell the engine the pointer jumped there, and Roblox's UI does hit
/// testing against the reported absolute position — a jump risks nudging
/// whatever the real cursor happens to be hovering. If no genuine pointer
/// event has ever landed there is nothing honest to resend, so this does
/// nothing rather than guess.
///
/// Called from [`super::looper::pump`] every tick a key is held; harmless to
/// call when the interface native is not registered yet, since
/// [`pass_mouse_move_delta`] already falls through to
/// [`report_unregistered`]'s deduplicated logging rather than spamming.
/// When Cordial stops sending [`idle_keepalive`], from `CORDIAL_THROTTLE`.
///
/// The shell's "Slow the game down in the background" row sets this; see

/// why `Visible` is the default rather than `Unfocused`. Parsed once, because
/// the launch settles it and nothing changes it mid-run.
///
