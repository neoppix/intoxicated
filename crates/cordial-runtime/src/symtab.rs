//! Builds the `{soname -> {symbol -> address}}` tables handed to the linker.
//!
//! Each of Roblox's imports resolves one of two ways:
//!
//! * **host** — the desktop already has a compatible implementation. True for
//!   libm and libz (plain C, scalar and pointer arguments) and for GLES2/EGL
//!   (Khronos-specified; Mesa implements the same contract).
//! * **stub** — everything else, for now.
//!
//! `libc` is deliberately *not* resolved from the host by default. bionic and
//! glibc disagree on `struct stat`, `pthread_mutex_t`, `DIR`, `FILE` and
//! `sigset_t`, so passthrough would silently corrupt rather than work. Closing
//! that gap is what a bionic shim is for; see docs/base-evaluation.md §4.
//!
//! That is a default for the *library*, not a verdict on every symbol in it. An
//! individual entry point whose arguments are laid out identically in both
//! libcs can be answered from the host safely, and five of them are: see
//! `bionic::pthread`'s `once` for the ABI comparison that has to be done, per
//! symbol and measured, before adding a sixth.
