//! What the engine's own log says about joining and leaving a game.
//!
//! **`bloxstrap_rpc` has been in this crate since presence landed, with a
//! parser, tests, and no callers at all.** `grep 'bloxstrap_rpc::'` across the
//! workspace returned nothing: the protocol was implemented and nothing ever
//! read a line to hand it. This module is the missing half -- the thing that
//! watches the file -- and once it exists the same lines answer three other
//! questions Cordial could not answer before.
//!
//! Nothing is injected and nothing is hooked. The engine writes a log into a
//! directory Cordial created, and Cordial reads it. That is the argument
//! `bloxstrap_rpc`'s own header already makes about why this runs into neither
//! ADR-001 nor ADR-003, and it applies unchanged here.
//!
//! ## The markers, and where they came from
//!
//! Read off a real capture rather than guessed: Sober's own log of the same
//! engine on this host, `2.734.0.917_20260831T031139Z_Player_3e43f_last.log`,
//! 1,627 lines covering four joins and four leaves -- the parser run over the
//! whole of it finds all eight and nothing else. AGENTS.md's rule about
//! grepping a capture before reasoning from a binary is the same rule one
//! level up, and this is the capture.
//!
//! ```text
//! [FLog::GameJoinLoadTime] Report game_join_loadtime: sid:6baeb082-..., \
//!     clienttime:..., join_time:1.2011154180, referral_page:, \
//!     placeid:17625359962, userid:1826805362, universeid:6035872082,
//! [FLog::Network] UDMUX Address = 128.116.51.33, Port = 50363 | \
//!     RCC Server Address = 10.60.2.168, Port = 50363
//! [FLog::SingleSurfaceApp] leaveUGCGameInternal
//! ```
//!
//! **The log carries no game name, and this module does not invent one.** It
//! reports the place and universe ids, which is what is actually there;
//! resolving either to a title needs a request to Roblox's web API and belongs
//! to whoever wants the title, not to a log parser. Saying so matters because
//! the README currently states that Discord presence "cannot name the game yet
//! -- no core event carries which place is running", and that is still true of
//! *core events*: what changes is that the id is now available from somewhere
//! else, so the sentence is worth revisiting rather than deleting.
//!
//! **`UDMUX Address` is the server's address and not its location.** Turning
//! one into the other is a geo-IP lookup against a third party, which is a
//! network call on somebody's behalf and a privacy question, so this module
//! stops at the address.
